## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Home Assistant development environment
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nordpool.git
cd nordpool
```

2. **Create a development branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

3. **Install in Home Assistant**

```bash
# Link to your Home Assistant custom_components directory
ln -s $(pwd)/custom_components/nordpool ~/.homeassistant/custom_components/nordpool
```

4. **Enable debug logging**

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.nordpool: debug
```

5. **Restart Home Assistant and test your changes**

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Code Quality

- **Format your code**: Use `black` for formatting
- **Lint your code**: Use `pylint` or `flake8`
- **Test your changes**: Ensure existing functionality still works
- **Add comments**: Explain complex logic

### Example Code Style

```python
async def calculate_price(
    self,
    base_price: float,
    vat: float,
    additional_costs: float
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the final price including VAT and additional costs.

    Args:
        base_price: Base electricity price from Nord Pool
        vat: VAT rate (e.g., 0.25 for 25%)
        additional_costs: Additional costs per kWh

    Returns:
        Final calculated price
    """
    return (base_price + additional_costs) * (1 + vat)
```
